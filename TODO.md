# Todo

- [ ] update existing pyproject.toml only with update_pyproject task, not in jinja!

- [ ] Provide backup and restore scripts (invoke tasks)

    We need to do this, because pyproject can already exist.
- [ ] Update absolute paths from current directory

    This is useful if you checkout the same repo in different locations (server, dev env).

- [ ] Ask for client counts in ZEO and relStorage setups and create configs

- [ ] Integrate repoplone's dependency-constraints updater
