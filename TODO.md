# Todo

## Integrate repoplone's dependency-constraints updater

## Update absolute paths from current directory

This is useful if you checkout the same repo in different locations (server, dev env).

## Ask for client counts in ZEO and relStorage setups and create configs

## Provide backup and restore scripts (invoke tasks)
